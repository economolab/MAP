# IMPORTANT
- finish unit positions, almost done
- stimLoc **
    - photostim_start_times.control -> ogen_sites
- stimEpoch
    - this is just using photostim_start and end times

- fix getSeq and plotRaster
    - spike times should be based on trialtm, not using which trial time was in at the moment
    - see lickRaster()
- add trialtm and trial 
    - fix plotPSTH raster after you do this
    - needs to take into account trial start and end times
- GET KINEMATICS (make it like our obj.traj)
- lick raster
    - augment color based on lick dir and cond, not sure how yet tho
- heatmap axes
